# Swin-Transformer-Tensorflow
This repo is the unofficial Tensorflow implementation of ["Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030).  

The official Pytorch implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer).

## Updates:
June 12, 2021
- Completed transferring official PyTorch code of the Swin Transformer model to TensorFlow code.

## TODO:
- Write trainer code
    - Trainer
    - Optimizer
    - LR Scheduler
- Reproduce results presented in paper
- Attempt to reproduce torch.utils.checkpoints in TensorFlow
- Refactor code
